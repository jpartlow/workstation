# Puppetlabs Dev Environment

Primarily for integration.  Currently this is my way of capturing set up for an Ubuntu 14.04 dev box, so that I can recreate my dev environment automatically, either to restore on a new laptop or to do dev work from a vm.  Intention is to allow me to work with new/clean configuration without risking my current dev environment's stability for handling day to day work items.

## Vagrantfile

Provides a local vm for testing.
